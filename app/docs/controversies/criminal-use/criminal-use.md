# Bitcoin and Criminal Use

Bitcoin is often framed as the currency of choice for criminals: drug dealers, ransom attacks, money launderers. Critics cite Silk Road, darknet markets, and ransomware as evidence that Bitcoin is inherently a tool for illicit activity. This framing is misleading. Bitcoin is just money. What people do with it is their decision. The vast majority of illicit financial activity globally occurs in US dollars and the traditional banking system, not in Bitcoin.

## Money Is Neutral

Money is a tool—like a knife, a car, or cash—that can be used for good or ill. We do not blame the instrument for the choices of the person using it. Bitcoin is no different: it is a [protocol](/docs/bitcoin) for transferring value. It does not judge or refuse; it executes the rules that consensus agrees on. The person who breaks the law is responsible; the protocol that blindly processes valid transactions is not. Blaming Bitcoin for crime confuses the instrument with the actor. The question is whether we hold money itself responsible for its users' choices. The answer is no.

## The USD Reality

Most illicit financial activity globally occurs in US dollars and the traditional banking system. Money laundering, sanctions evasion, corruption, and fraud have used fiat and banks for decades, long before Bitcoin existed. UNODC, FinCEN, and similar bodies report that the bulk of illicit financial flows moves through correspondent banking, shell companies, and cash; cryptocurrency is a small fraction by volume. Bitcoin did not invent financial crime. To single it out is to ignore where the problem actually lives.

## Why Bitcoin Gets the Blame

- **Transparency**: Bitcoin's blockchain is public. When Bitcoin appears in a crime, it is visible, traceable, and widely reported. Illicit use of cash is largely invisible, so it is largely unremarked. Bitcoin gets blamed not because it is used more for crime, but because when it is used, we can see it.
- **Novelty**: Bitcoin is new; "crypto" attracts political and media attention. Fiat banking's role in crime is old news. The novelty makes Bitcoin a convenient villain and a useful narrative for regulators who want to justify AML and KYC rules that extend state control over financial rails.
- **The narrative sells**: The "Bitcoin for criminals" story fits agendas—more surveillance, more KYC, more gatekeepers at the borders of the [network](/docs/bitcoin/p2p-protocol). It is easier to rally support for cracking down on something that sounds dangerous and unfamiliar than to address the systemic role of fiat and banking in illicit flows.

## The Traceability Irony

Bitcoin is one of the *least* attractive currencies for sophisticated criminals who want to evade detection.

- **Public ledger**: Every transaction is recorded. [Blockchain monitoring](/docs/bitcoin-development/blockchain-monitoring) and chain analysis can trace flows, cluster addresses, and link them to exchanges.
- **KYC at off-ramps**: Converting Bitcoin to fiat usually requires an exchange or similar service that collects identity under KYC and AML rules. That creates a durable link between on-chain activity and real-world identity.
- **Cash is more anonymous**: Physical cash leaves no permanent record. For someone who wants to obscure the origin of funds, cash is far more convenient than a transparent, permanent blockchain.

The same transparency that makes Bitcoin's use in crime *visible* also makes it *traceable*. It is not the preferred tool for serious, organized crime; it is used in some crimes because it is convenient for cross-border, digital payments, but so is the traditional banking system, at far greater scale.

## The Real Question

The question is not "Is Bitcoin ever used by criminals?" Any valuable tool is. The question is: **Should we hold money itself responsible for its users' choices?** The answer is no. Those who condemn Bitcoin for criminal use while ignoring the role of the US dollar and the banking system in the vast majority of illicit finance are not making an honest argument about crime. They are making an argument about which forms of money they wish to control.
