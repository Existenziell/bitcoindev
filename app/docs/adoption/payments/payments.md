# Payments: Bitcoin as Money

Bitcoin functions as a medium of exchange: individuals and businesses use it for daily payments, merchant acceptance, and cross-border commerce. The Lightning Network enables fast, low-cost transactions that make Bitcoin practical for everything from coffee to supplier payments.

## Why Bitcoin for Payments?

### Advantages

- **Global**: Accept or send payments from anywhere, without borders
- **Low fees**: Especially with Lightning—fractions of a cent vs. card networks
- **Final settlement**: No chargebacks; transactions are irreversible once confirmed
- **No intermediaries**: Peer-to-peer; no need for a bank or payment processor to approve
- **24/7**: No business hours or settlement delays

### Trade-offs

- **Volatility**: Bitcoin's price can fluctuate; merchants often convert to local currency
- **Learning curve**: Wallets and UX are improving but still require some education
- **Regulatory variance**: Acceptance and reporting rules differ by jurisdiction

## Lightning Network and Daily Payments

The Lightning Network is a second layer on top of Bitcoin that enables:

- **Instant confirmation**: Payments settle in seconds
- **Micropayments**: Economical for small amounts (coffee, phone credit, tips)
- **High throughput**: Millions of transactions without congesting the base layer

This makes Bitcoin practical for everyday spending. For protocol details, see Lightning Network.

## Merchant and Business Adoption

### Payment Acceptance

Businesses accept Bitcoin to:

- **Reach global customers**: Anyone with Bitcoin can pay, regardless of location
- **Reduce fees**: Lower cost than many card and wire options, especially with Lightning
- **Avoid chargebacks**: On-chain and Lightning payments are final
- **Differentiate**: Appeal to Bitcoin-using customers and early adopters

### Examples

- **Overstock**: Early adopter of Bitcoin acceptance
- **Microsoft**: Accepts Bitcoin for digital purchases (e.g. store credit)
- **AT&T**: Accepts Bitcoin for bill payments
- **El Salvador**: Merchants accept Bitcoin via Lightning for groceries, transport, and services (see Financial Inclusion)

### Challenges for Merchants

- **Volatility**: Many merchants convert to fiat immediately via payment processors
- **Regulation**: Tax and reporting rules vary by country
- **Integration**: Processors (e.g. BitPay, Strike, OpenNode) simplify integration

## From Remittances to Supplier Payments

Bitcoin is used not only for consumer payments but for:

- **Remittances**: Migrant workers sending money home (see Financial Inclusion)
- **B2B and supplier payments**: Businesses paying overseas suppliers in Bitcoin to avoid FX friction and delays
- **Freelance and remote work**: Getting paid in Bitcoin across borders without traditional banking
