# Financial Inclusion

Bitcoin, combined with the Lightning Network, is enabling financial services for communities that traditional banking has failed to serve. From remittances to savings to daily payments, Bitcoin is providing financial access to billions of people worldwide. In countries with capital controls or where accounts can be frozen, Bitcoin's [censorship resistance](/philosophy/fundamentals/trust-model) allows people to move and store value without permission from banks or governments.

## The Banking Gap

### The Problem

Over 1.7 billion adults worldwide lack access to traditional banking services. They face:

- **No bank accounts**: Banks don't operate in remote or underserved areas
- **High fees**: Remittances can cost 10-20% of the amount sent
- **Slow transfers**: International transfers can take days or weeks
- **Currency restrictions**: Limited ability to hold or transfer foreign currencies
- **Inflation risk**: Local currencies can lose value rapidly
- **Censorship**: Accounts can be frozen or restricted

Traditional banking requires:
- **Physical infrastructure**: Branches, ATMs, payment networks
- **Regulatory compliance**: KYC/AML requirements that exclude many people
- **Minimum balances**: Account requirements that many can't meet
- **Credit history**: Requirements that exclude the unbanked

### The Solution

Bitcoin requires only:
- **A smartphone**: Most people in developing countries have smartphones
- **Internet connection**: Mobile data is widely available
- **No bank account**: Bitcoin operates without banks
- **No permission**: Anyone can use Bitcoin

This makes Bitcoin uniquely suited to serve the unbanked.

## Remittances

### The Traditional Remittance Problem

Remittances (money sent by migrant workers to their families) are a lifeline for millions. But traditional remittances have major problems:

- **High fees**: Average fees of 6-10%, often much higher
- **Slow transfers**: Can take days to arrive
- **Limited access**: Recipients may need to travel to pickup locations
- **Currency conversion**: Multiple currency conversions add costs
- **Limited hours**: Services may only be available during business hours

Bitcoin, especially via the Lightning Network, offers low fees (typically under 1%), instant settlement, 24/7 availability, and direct transfer without intermediaries. See Payments for Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and merchant adoption.

### Real-World Examples

**El Salvador**: After adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, remittances became faster and cheaper. Families receive money directly in Bitcoin wallets, avoiding traditional remittance fees. See [Institutional Adoption](/philosophy/adoption/institutional-adoption) for country-level adoption and [NBER digest on El Salvador's experiment](https://www.nber.org/digest/202207/el-salvadors-experiment-bitcoin-legal-tender) for research.

**Africa**: Services like [Strike](https://strike.me) (including [Strike Africa](https://strike.me/blog/announcing-strike-africa/)) and [Bitnob](https://bitnob.com) enable Bitcoin remittances across the continent, reducing costs and increasing speed. When Tanzania's internet went dark, [Bitcoin bridged a family across the border](https://techcabal.com/2025/11/11/tanzania-internet-shutdown-bitcoin-for-remittance/) when other channels failed. For broader context, see [Reuters on Bitcoin and the real world in Africa](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-africa-insight-idUSKBN25Z0Q8/).

**Philippines**: [Coins.ph](https://www.coins.ph) enables Bitcoin remittances, allowing overseas workers to send money home instantly and cheaply.

**Adoption stories**: [Bitcoin Magazine on El Salvador adoption](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-adoption-el-salvador-stories) and [on the coast of El Salvador](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/on-the-coast-of-el-salvador-bitcoin-is-becoming-the-standard) offer on-the-ground reporting.

## Savings and Store of Value

In many developing countries, high inflation or banking crises make local-currency savings risky. Bitcoin offers a way to save without a bank: fixed supply, no inflation, self-custody, and portability. People in Venezuela, Nigeria, Lebanon, and similar contexts use it to preserve savings when local currency or banks fail.

For why Bitcoin stores value, how it behaves under capital controls, and more country examples, see Store of Value.

## Daily Payments

In rural and developing areas, cash-only economies and limited card or mobile-money options make daily payments costly or inaccessible. The Lightning Network enables cheap, instant small payments—phone credit, groceries, transport—without a bank account. El Salvador, African communities, and other remote areas are using Bitcoin and Lightning for everyday spending where traditional rails don't reach.

For merchant acceptance, business adoption, and protocol details, see Payments.

## El Salvador: National Adoption

In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Remittances became faster and cheaper, and more people gained access to digital payments; challenges included technical complexity, volatility, and uneven infrastructure. For country-level policy and further reading, see Institutional Adoption.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Technical Challenges

**Internet access**: Bitcoin requires internet connectivity
- **Solution**: Mobile data is increasingly available, even in rural areas
- **Offline options**: Some wallets support offline transaction signing

**Smartphone availability**: Bitcoin wallets need smartphones
- **Solution**: Smartphone adoption is growing rapidly worldwide
- **Lightweight clients**: SPV wallets reduce resource requirements

**User education**: Bitcoin has a learning curve
- **Solution**: Simplified wallets, educational resources, community support
- **Gradual adoption**: Start with simple use cases (remittances) before advanced features

### Economic Challenges

**Volatility**: Bitcoin price can fluctuate significantly
- **Solution**: Lightning Network enables instant conversion to local currency
- **Education**: Understanding volatility helps users make informed decisions
- **Gradual adoption**: Start small, learn, then increase usage

**Liquidity**: Converting Bitcoin to local currency
- **Solution**: Bitcoin ATMs, peer-to-peer exchanges, merchant acceptance
- **Growing infrastructure**: More options for buying and selling Bitcoin

### Regulatory Challenges

**Government restrictions**: Some governments restrict Bitcoin
- **Solution**: Bitcoin is censorship-resistant; restrictions are difficult to enforce
- **Education**: Demonstrating Bitcoin's benefits can change attitudes
- **Advocacy**: Working with governments to create favorable regulations

## Future Potential

The potential for Bitcoin to serve the unbanked is enormous:

- **1.7 billion unbanked adults**: Massive addressable market
- **Growing smartphone adoption**: More people can access Bitcoin
- **Improving infrastructure**: Better internet and mobile networks
- **Lightning Network growth**: Faster, cheaper payments
- **Education and awareness**: More people learning about Bitcoin

As Bitcoin infrastructure improves and adoption grows, more communities will gain access to financial services through Bitcoin.
