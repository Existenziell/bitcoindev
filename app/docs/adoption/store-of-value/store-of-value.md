# Store of Value

Bitcoin's fixed supply and predictable issuance make it attractive as a store of value. People in high-inflation countries use it to preserve savings; others hold it long-term as a digital alternative to gold. Bitcoin also offers **censorship resistance**: in countries with capital controls or unstable banking, it allows people to hold and move value without permission from banks or governments.

## Why Bitcoin Stores Value

### Monetary Properties

- **Fixed supply**: Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist
- **Predictable issuance**: Supply schedule is known and decreasing (halvings)
- **No inflation**: No central authority can print more
- **Global**: Not tied to any single country's economy or policy
- **Self-custody**: You control your keys; no bank can freeze or seize your bitcoin
- **Portable**: Can be taken across borders without asking permission

These properties make Bitcoin useful as a long-term store of value and as a hedge against inflation and currency failure. See Monetary Properties for the economic foundations.

## Censorship Resistance and Capital Controls

In addition to inflation, many people face **capital controls** or **account freezes**. Governments may limit how much currency can be moved abroad or block access to bank accounts. Bitcoin's decentralized, permissionless design allows users to:

- Hold value outside the traditional banking system
- Move value across borders without intermediary approval
- Preserve wealth when local currency is restricted or collapsing

Empirical research has shown that Bitcoin adoption correlates with capital controls and weak monetary institutions—people use it as an institutional hedge and a means to preserve or move value when options are limited. This use case is distinct from speculation: it is adoption driven by necessity.

## High-Inflation and Crisis Countries

### Venezuela

Citizens use Bitcoin to preserve savings as the bolivar hyperinflates, despite government restrictions.

### Argentina

Bitcoin protects savings from persistent high inflation and currency controls.

### Turkey

Bitcoin provides a hedge against currency devaluation and political uncertainty.

### Lebanon

During the 2019-2020 banking crisis, Lebanese turned to Bitcoin as the banking system collapsed.

### Nigeria

Nigerians use Bitcoin to protect against currency devaluation and capital controls; the country has been among the largest Bitcoin trading markets by volume. Adoption has been driven by naira weakness and limited access to foreign exchange.

## Long-Term Holding

Many investors hold Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, similar to gold but with digital advantages: divisibility, portability, verifiability, and programmable scarcity.
