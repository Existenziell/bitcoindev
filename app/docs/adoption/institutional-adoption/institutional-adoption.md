# Institutional Adoption

Bitcoin adoption is not limited to individuals. Companies hold Bitcoin in treasury reserves, and some countries have recognized it as legal tender or adopted favorable regulation. This section covers corporate and country-level adoption.

## Corporate Treasury Reserves

Companies hold Bitcoin as part of their treasury for:

- **Inflation hedge**: Protect corporate cash from currency devaluation
- **Diversification**: Non-correlated asset alongside traditional reserves
- **Store of value**: Long-term value preservation
- **Network effects**: Belief that Bitcoin's value increases with adoption

### Notable Examples

**MicroStrategy**: The largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with over 190,000 BTC as of 2024. The company uses Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset and has raised debt to purchase Bitcoin. [MicroStrategy](https://www.microstrategy.com/) (corporate site).

**Block (formerly Square)**: Holds Bitcoin in treasury and enables Bitcoin services through Cash App, making it easy for users to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin. [Block](https://block.xyz/) (corporate site).

**Tesla**: Briefly held Bitcoin and accepted it as payment for vehicles before suspending due to environmental concerns.

**Other companies**: A growing list holds Bitcoin in treasury, including Coinbase, Marathon Digital Holdings, Hut 8 Mining, and Galaxy Digital.

## Country-Level Adoption

### El Salvador

In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender:

- **Legal tender status**: Bitcoin must be accepted alongside the US dollar
- **Chivo wallet**: Government wallet with $30 in Bitcoin for citizens
- **Infrastructure**: Bitcoin ATMs, mining with geothermal energy
- **Results**: Faster remittances, lower fees, increased financial inclusion (see [Financial Inclusion](/philosophy/adoption/financial-inclusion))

### Central African Republic

In 2022, the CAR adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, though implementation faced challenges due to infrastructure limitations.

### Other Jurisdictions

Several countries have favorable or clarifying regulation for Bitcoin:

- **Ukraine**: Accepts Bitcoin donations; has considered regulatory clarity for crypto
- **Switzerland**: Bitcoin-friendly regulation and banking access
- **Portugal**: Tax-friendly treatment for Bitcoin in certain cases
- **Singapore**: Regulatory clarity for Bitcoin businesses

## Rationale and Challenges

Institutions adopt Bitcoin for similar reasons as individuals: store of value, inflation hedge, and access to a global, censorship-resistant asset. Challenges include:

- **Volatility**: Price swings affect treasury valuation
- **Accounting and regulation**: Treatment varies by jurisdiction (e.g. FASB, SEC, local tax)
- **Custody**: Securing large amounts requires robust key management and procedures
