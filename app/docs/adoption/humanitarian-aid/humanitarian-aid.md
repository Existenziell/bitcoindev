# Humanitarian Aid

Bitcoin enables direct aid delivery: donors can send value to recipients without traditional intermediaries, reducing costs and the risk of corruption or blockage. In crises—from war to natural disaster—Bitcoin has been used to get help to people quickly and transparently.

## The Problem with Traditional Aid

Traditional aid delivery often faces:

- **Corruption**: Aid can be stolen or misdirected before it reaches recipients
- **Intermediaries**: Multiple layers add costs and delays
- **Restrictions**: Governments can block or restrict aid flows
- **Currency issues**: Local currency volatility, capital controls, or banking collapse can prevent aid from being used

## How Bitcoin Helps

Bitcoin offers:

- **Direct transfer**: Send value directly to recipients' wallets
- **Fewer intermediaries**: Reduces points of failure and diversion
- **Censorship resistance**: Governments cannot easily block Bitcoin transfers
- **Transparency**: On-chain visibility (where desired) for accountability
- **Speed**: The [Lightning Network](/docs/lightning) enables instant, low-cost transfers

## Examples

### Ukraine

During the 2022 invasion, Ukraine received millions of dollars in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency donations. The government and NGOs used crypto to fund humanitarian and defense efforts, with funds arriving quickly and without relying solely on traditional banking channels.

### Disaster Relief

Bitcoin and Lightning can enable rapid aid in disaster situations when banking infrastructure is damaged or overloaded.

## Limitations

- **Recipients need access**: Wallets, smartphones, and (often) conversion to local currency
- **Volatility**: Aid organizations often convert to fiat quickly
- **Regulation**: Compliance and reporting vary by jurisdiction

Bitcoin is one tool among many; it is most useful where traditional channels are slow, expensive, or blocked.
